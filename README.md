subnodes
========

Subnodes is an open source project that enables people to easily set up portable access points for serving content.
This project is an initiative focused on streamlining the process of setting up a Raspberry Pi as a wireless access
point for distributing content, media, and shared digital experiences. The device behaves as a web server, creating
its own local area network, and does not connect with the internet. This is key for the sake of offering a space
where people can communicate anonymously and freely, as well as maximizing the portability of the network
(no dependibility on an internet connection means the device can be taken and remain active anywhere). Future plans
include enabling mesh networking so that devices within proximity to each other becomes a node in a greater local
network, extending range and making it possible to exchange information with each other. Support for Subnodes has
been provided by Eyebeam. This code is published under the [AGPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).
